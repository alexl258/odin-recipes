    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious pepper steak recipe served with boiled white rice â€” easy and made from items I've already got in my cupboards.</p>
    <p>My mother clipped this recipe from somewhere and it became a specialty of mine; however, I've been unable to find the original source.</p>    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steak</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbs white sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbs cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 Tbs vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 chopped red onion</li>
        <li>1 chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>2 wedged tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Slice steak:</strong> Into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk together:</strong> Soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Place steak slices into the marinade, and stir until well-coated.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook steak strips in batches in hot oil so as not to crowd the pan. Cook and stir until well-browned, about 3 minutes, and remove steak from the wok to a bowl. Repeat with remaining steak, adding more oil as needed, and set the cooked meat aside..</li>
        <li>Return cooked steak strips to the hot wok, and stir in onion. Toss steak and onion together until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then stir in green pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook and stir the mixture:</strong> Until peppers have turned bright green and started to become tender, about 2 minutes more, then add tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Stir everything together to mix and blend flavors, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
